## 📖 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture in JavaScript.
- Handling **API requests** with `fetch` and `async/await`.
- **State management** and updating the UI efficiently.
- Using **localStorage** for persisting data.
- Working with modern **ES6 modules** and **Parcel bundler**.
